# real-estate
In this project, i will consume a real estate API to search for properties to rent or for sale in USA.

## Stack
  JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
  
## Challenges
  The most challenging functionality for me in this project was to create dynamically the cards to display the houses details after the fetch in API.
  
## The Project
  A page with a form that you have to insert the state code and the city in order to fetch in the API. Otherwise it wont work.
